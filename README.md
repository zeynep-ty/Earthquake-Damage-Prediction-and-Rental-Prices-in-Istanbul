# Earthquake Damage Prediction and Rental Prices in Istanbul
Term Project for DSA210: Introduction to Data Science

## Project Overview 
Istanbul is a highly populated city with a large number of buildings and a well-known high earthquake risk due to its location near active fault lines. This project aims to analyze the relationship between earthquake damage risk and rental housing prices across Istanbul's different districts and neighborhoods. By considering the predicted building damage and casualty rates at the disrict and neighborhood level under a potential 7.5 magnitude earthquake, rental prices will be examined together with building-related features such as age, floor level, apartment size, and number of rooms to determine which factors most strongly influence rent values. The ultimate goal is to provide insights on Istanbul's housing market dynamics and urban planning, while also guiding safer housing decisions. 

## Motivation
Recently, while searching for a new apartment in Istanbul with my family, the main factor we considered was the earthquake damage risk of the buildings and districts. This experince led me to wonder how and to what extent this factor influences rental prices across the city, and whether people's housing decisions reflect earthquake risk awareness. 

## Objectives
- Analyze how rental prices across Istanbul differ according to earthquake damage and casualty risk levels at the district and neighborhood scale.
- Examine how property characteristics — such as building age, floor level, apartment size, and number of rooms — influence rental values.
- Determine which of these factors have the strongest overall effect on housing prices and how they interact with earthquake risk.
- Compare the relative impact of seismic risk and property features to identify which plays a more dominant role in shaping rent variation.
