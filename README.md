# Earthquake Damage Prediction and Rental Prices in Istanbul
Term Project for DSA210: Introduction to Data Science

## Project Overview 
Istanbul is a highly populated city with a large number of buildings and a well-known high earthquake risk due to its location near active fault lines. This project aims to analyze the relationship between earthquake damage risk and rental housing prices across Istanbul's different districts and neighborhoods. 

## Motivation
Recently, while searching for a new apartment in Istanbul with my family, the main factor we considered was the earthquake damage risk of the buildings and districts. This experince led me to wonder how and to what extent this factor influences rental prices compared to other factors like building age, floor and size.
